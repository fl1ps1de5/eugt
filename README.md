This repo currently contains 3 directories:

1. VariousGymTesting

This dir contains files that represent my first exploration into the usage and functionality of isaac gym. 

cartpole_tensor_DOF.py - explores how forces can be applied to a DOF using Isaac Gym Tensor API, adds random forces and then simulates the movement of a Cartpole
cartpole_manual_DOF.py - explores how the user can manually apply forces to a DOF. Allows the user to use the keypad to move the Cartpole, and spacebar to change the DOF being controlled.
